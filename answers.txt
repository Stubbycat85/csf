Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

...

Problem 2:

0.43029262963

Problem 3:

The program ceases to function. The linenum variable is required to determine what like the program is trying to analyze. The program needs to know to only read every 4 lines, if linenum is undefined, it is trying to analyze lines of text that can't be analyzed by the program.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852


Collaboration:

No one

Reflection:

No time for reflection! Too behind on programming hw!


Problem 5:

sample_1.fastq
GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852
A Count: 7701287
T Count: 7661547
G Count: 5738773
C Count: 5879128
Sum Count: 26980735

Problem 6:

It appears that the totals for Sum Count are always different (except in the case of the small test) than the totals for the Length and the Total Count. This is because there exists a 5th variable, N, in the sequences, that is being counted in the total count and the sequence length but obviously not being counted in the sum of A, T, G, and C. This would of course throw off the GC content if the code was still using the total count instead of the sum count as the denominator, and Ill correct that now.

Problem 7:

Sample 1:
AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

Sample 1:
CG Classification: This is a moderate GC content organism

Feels good to be catching up, was daunted by this assignment at first but it started to click here
